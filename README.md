# CSCA 5632 Unsupervised Algorithms Final Project

For this project, my goal is to analyze various factors that impact a customer's review rating for different types of clothing. To accomplish this, I developed a Cosine Similarity Matrix to compare user-item relationships based on their interactions. I am particularly interested in discovering which features influence customer ratings the most, as fashion is a dynamic and ever-changing subject for me. Understanding what the majority of people like and prefer based on contextual features would provide valuable insights. I predict that Discounts will be the most impactful feature, as that is something I personally prioritize when purchasing clothes. To support this analysis, I will use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize the dataset and explore relationships between different features.

The dataset I am using is [Customer Shopping Trends Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset/).
